In this project we look at the trends in Expected Goals Difference for the top 6 English Premier League teams since the start of season 2019/2020 upto gameweek 4 of season 23/24 (03/09/2023).
The intention was to quantify the underlying performance metrics of the top 6 teams to see how they had progressed/regressed since the start of the season 2019/2020 season.

## Key Definitions
- **Expected Goals (xG):** A statistical metric used in soccer to assess the quality of a scoring opportunity. It quantifies the likelihood that a shot will result in a goal based on historical data and various factors.
- **Expected Goals Against (xGA):** The cumulative xG value of all the shots conceded by a team, reflecting the expected goals their opponents could have scored.
- **xG Difference (xGD):** The metric that calculates the difference between a team's xG and xGA. A positive xGD indicates a team is expected to score more goals than they are likely to concede.

## Key Findings
- Manchester City has been the best-performing team in the English Premier League since Boxing Day 2019.
- Arsenal has shown significant improvement in performance during the analyzed timeframe.
- Liverpool challenged City's dominance in the 21/22 season but has since seen a decline.
- Chelsea has been the worst-performing side in the sample.

- ## Libraries Used
- Pandas
